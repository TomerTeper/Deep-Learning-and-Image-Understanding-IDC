## README: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Image Captioning

### Overview
This project involves implementing a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to understand its structure and how it processes sequential data. The first part of the exercise focuses on manually implementing the RNN cell, ensuring a deep understanding of its mechanics before transitioning to PyTorch for training and evaluation. Additionally, this project includes implementing an **image captioning model** using a pretrained neural network.

### Project Structure
- **Understanding the RNN Cell**: Learning how the RNN structure handles sequential inputs.
- **Manual RNN Implementation**: Implementing forward and backward passes of an RNN **without using PyTorch**.
- **Forward Propagation**: Implementing `rnn_step_forward` to compute a single timestep.
- **Backward Propagation**: Implementing `rnn_step_backward` to compute gradients.
- **Complete RNN Implementation**: Extending the step-wise implementation to process full sequences.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Transitioning to PyTorch for training the RNN on sequential data.
- **GPU/CPU Compatibility**: Ensuring the model works on both CPU and GPU.
- **Implementing Image Captioning Model**: Using a pretrained model for generating captions from images.

### Implementing Image Captioning Model **(40 points)**
As training a multimodal classifier could take considerable time and resources, the training phase has been skipped in this exercise. Instead, a **pretrained model** is used to solve the image captioning task. Leveraging pretrained models is a common practice in the deep learning community, allowing for efficient utilization of resources while maintaining high performance. 

The provided files include the necessary components for loading the pretrained model. However, in order to use the pretrained model effectively, the same **PyTorch model architecture** must be constructed.

**ConvNet architecture:**
- `resnet152` (without the final fully connected layer) → Fully Connected (FC) Layer → BatchNorm1d

**LSTM architecture:**
- LSTM → Linear Layer → Embedding Layer

Detailed instructions are provided in the following cells of the notebook. Please ensure that the models are constructed based on the specified sizes to ensure compatibility with the pretrained weights.

### Key Topics Covered

- `matplotlib` – For visualizing training progress.
- `torch` – For training and evaluating the RNN and image captioning model.
- `torchvision` – For handling pre-trained convolutional models.

### Summary
This project provides hands-on experience in implementing an RNN from scratch without relying on **PyTorch**, ensuring a deep understanding of how RNNs process sequential data. The later part transitions into PyTorch for more efficient training. Additionally, this project explores **image captioning** using a **pretrained ResNet152 and LSTM model**, emphasizing the importance of **transfer learning** in modern deep learning applications. By covering both manual and framework-based implementations, this exercise builds a strong foundation for more advanced sequence-based and multimodal architectures.
