## README: Linear Image Classifier

### Overview
This project involves implementing a **linear image classifier** while gaining familiarity with `numpy` and vectorized operations in Python. The exercise consists of two main parts:
1. Implementing loss functions, calculating gradients, and implementing gradient descent.
2. Training and evaluating multiple classifiers.

### Project Structure
- **Loss Function Implementation**: Implement different loss functions, compute their gradients, and apply gradient descent optimization to minimize loss.
- **Classifier Training**: Train multiple classifiers using different hyperparameters and evaluate their performance based on accuracy and loss.
- **Data Processing**: Load and preprocess the dataset, including normalization and feature extraction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimization techniques.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compare classifiers using accuracy metrics and visualize their decision boundaries.

### Key Topics Covered
- **Linear Classification**: Using linear functions to separate data into different classes.
- **Perceptron Algorithm**: A simple linear classifier that updates weights iteratively based on misclassified samples. The perceptron learns by adjusting its weights through the perceptron learning rule.
  - *Evaluation*: Perceptron performance is evaluated using accuracy and the number of misclassified samples. It works well for linearly separable data but fails for non-linearly separable cases.
- **Perceptron Loss**: The perceptron loss function is defined as the number of misclassified examples. Unlike other loss functions, it does not provide a smooth gradient, making optimization challenging.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization (Perceptron)**: Involves tuning parameters like the learning rate and number of iterations to improve classification accuracy.
- **Logistic Regression**: A probabilistic linear classifier used for binary classification. It models the probability that a given instance belongs to a particular class using the sigmoid function.
  - *Binary Cross-Entropy Loss*: Also known as log loss, it measures the difference between actual labels and predicted probabilities. It is defined as:
    \[ L = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(\hat{y_i}) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y_i})] \]
  - *Hyperparameter Optimization (Logistic Regression)*: Includes tuning the learning rate, regularization strength (L1/L2), and number of training iterations to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization.
- **Gradient Calculation**: Computing derivatives to optimize the model's parameters.
- **Gradient Descent Optimization**: Updating weights using techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
- **Training Classifiers**: Training different models and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing classifier performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

### Summary
This project provides hands-on experience in building a linear classifier from scratch using `numpy`. It covers essential machine learning concepts such as loss functions, gradient computation, and optimization techniques. By implementing and training various classifiers, the project enhances understanding of fundamental ML principles and model evaluation strategies. The knowledge gained from this exercise is essential for developing more advanced machine learning models in future studies.
