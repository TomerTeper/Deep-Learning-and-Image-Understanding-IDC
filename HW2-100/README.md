## README: Neural Networks Classifier

### Overview
This project involves implementing a **three-layer multi-class neural network** to classify data. It builds upon the previous exercise, where a single-layer linear classifier was implemented.

### Project Structure
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Implementing a three-layer neural network for multi-class classification.
- **Forward Propagation**: Computing activations for each layer using nonlinear activation functions.
- **Loss Function**: Implementing cross-entropy loss for evaluating classification performance.
- **Backward Propagation**: Computing gradients and updating network weights using optimization techniques.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Training the network and assessing its performance on a dataset.

### Key Topics Covered
- **Neural Networks**: Implementing a feedforward neural network with multiple layers.
- **Activation Functions**: Applying nonlinear functions such as ReLU and softmax.
- **Forward and Backward Propagation**: Computing gradients and updating parameters efficiently.
- **Loss Functions**: Using cross-entropy loss to measure classification performance.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Applying gradient descent and its variants for training.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measuring accuracy and loss during training and testing.
